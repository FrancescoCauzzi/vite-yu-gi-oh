The :card="card" is binding the card variable from the v-for loop to a prop called card in a custom Vue.js component.

In other words, the card variable in the v-for loop represents each individual item in the store.cards.data array, and it is being passed down to a child component as a prop with the name card.

The : before card is shorthand for v-bind:card. This means that we are dynamically binding the value of card to the card prop of the child component.

For example, if the Card component had a prop called title instead of card, we would bind it like this: :title="card.title". This would pass the title property of each card item to the title prop of the Card component.

By using props in this way, we can make our code more modular and reusable by breaking it down into smaller components that can be used throughout our Vue.js application.
